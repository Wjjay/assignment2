                <p class="leftBlock">Although the idea of economic prosperity sounds nice to us as a species, we tend to ignore some of the side effects. It has been incredibly taxing on the environment as countries continue to industrialize, releasing immense quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and trapping in solar radiation. </p>
                <p class="rightBlock">If we continue to ignore the climate crisis, our future will be bleak. On land, we have observed some of the worst bushfires in recent history. In the ocean, coral reefs are dying at an unprecedented rate as increasing water temperatures is causing them to bleach out. This is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

            <div class="context">
                <p class="singleBlock", style="padding: 1px;">We can clearly see that there's a <b>strong positive correlation between CO2 output, GDP per capita, and temperature change</b>.</p>
                <p class="singleBlock">This does certainly make a lot of sense when we consider economic activities such as mining, manufacturing, and farming consumes tremendous amounts of fossil fuel to operate heavy machinery, transport goods, as well as conducting financial transactions.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 id="subtitle" style="padding-right: 6%;"><i>CO2 Per Capita by countries</i></h2>

            </div>

            <div class="context">
                <p class="singleBlock">In recent years, <i>Australia's</i> CO2 emission is comparable to economic powerhouses like the <i>United States</i> and <i>China</i> despite having a population size of roughly 20 million people</p>
                <p class="singleBlock"><b>2010</b> was the first time when <i>Australia's</i> CO2 emission per capita exceeded that of the <i>United States</i> at <b>17.581 metric tonnes</b> (vs 17.434 metric tonnes).</p>
                <p class="singleBlock"><i>Australia</i> has been beating the <i>United States</i> in this department after almost every subsequent year.</p>

                <p class="singleBlock", style="padding: 0px;">It seems like the country heavily relies on fossil fuels to keep up with domestic demands.</p>
                <p class="singleBlock", style="padding: 0px;"><i>Mining</i> eats up a sizeable chunk of the electricity pie. Since 2010, its electricity usage has <span style="font-size: 17px;"><b>more than doubled</b></span>. <br>Perhaps we can leverage that to reduce our CO2 emissions?</p>

            <h2 id="subtitle" style="padding-top: 7%; margin-top: 2%;">Introducing: <span class="u">Uranium</span></h2>

            <div class="context">
                <p class="leftBlock" style="padding:1px"><span class="u"><b>Uranium</b></span> is a naturally occurring resource that can be used to generate carbon-neutral electricity. Waste generated by nuclear fission are minimal because according to the <i>World Nuclear Association</i>, around <b>97%</b> of nuclear by-products are recyclable.</b> Most of the recycled waste will be combined with new nuclear materials to produce additional fuel rods.</p>
                <p class="rightBlock" style="padding: 1px;"><i>Australia</i> has been blessed with almost a third of the world's <span class="u"><b>Uranium</b></span> deposits. Unfortunately, almost none it have been utilised except for exportation. According to the <i>Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade</i>, the amount of <span class="u">Uranium</span> ores exported from Australia between 2018 and 2019 could generate <b>97%</b> of Australia's electricity alone.</p>

            <div class="context">
                <p class="singleBlock">Despite having a third of the world's supply of <span id="u">Uranium</span>, <i>Australia</i> is only contributing roughly to <b>10-15%</b> of the world's yearly demands.</p>
            </div>
                
            <h2 id="subtitle" style="padding-top: 3.5%;">Why choose <span class="u">Uranium</span>?</h2>

                <p class="singleBlock" style="padding-bottom: 1%; padding:0px">Let's compare various fuels in relation to coal! A kilogram of coal costs <b>94</b> US cents at the time of writing, and can produce <b>0.495</b> Megajoules of energy while emitting <b>0.84</b> kilograms of CO2. We'll use coal as a benchmark for comparing various fuel sources.</p>
                <p class="singleBlock">If one fuel source has a value of <i>100</i> for a particular category, say price, it means that it's as expensive as coal.<br>If it's <i>200</i>, then it's 2 times as expensive as coal.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="slope" class="vis"></div>

            <div class="context">
                <p class="singleBlock">We can see that <span class="u">Uranium</span> outclasses all other popular fuel sources in every category with the exception of price per kg.</p>
                <p class="singleBlock">However, that doesn't matter because if we consider the amount of energy we get per dollar, <span class="u">Uranium</span> ranks first with <span style="font-size: 20px;"><b>5712 MJ/$USD</b></span> while other fuels are struggling to hit <b>200 MJ/$USD</b>. By the way, it's emitting this much energy with <b>0 CO2 emissions</b>.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 id="subtitle" style="padding-top: 3%; margin-top: 6%;">What do voters think?</span>?</h2>

            <div class="context">
                <p class="singleBlock" style="margin-top: 1px"><i>Roy Morgan</i>, a reputable market research company has conducted polls about Australians' attitudes to nuclear power. These are some of their results:</p>
            </div>
            <div id="voter" class="vis"></div>

            <div class="context">
                <p class="leftBlock">It appears that more and more Australians are beginning to accept nuclear power in recent years. In <i>2019</i>, <b>51%</b> of Australians supported building nuclear powerplants for the sake of combating climate change.</p>
                <p class="rightBlock">This is number is expected to grow considering that global warming's impact on society will become more apparent in the future, which means that the idea of building nuclear powerplants in Australia will become more and more mainstream.</p>
                <p class="singleBlock">So what are you waiting for? Let's ditch coal and go nuclear!</p>
