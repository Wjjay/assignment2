                <p class="leftBlock">Although the idea of economic propserity sounds nice to us as a species, we tend to ignore some of the side effects. It has been incredibly taxing on the environment as countries continue to industrialize, releasing immense quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and trapping in the sun's heat. </p>
                <p class="rightBlock">If we continue to ignore the climate crisis, our future will be bleak. On land, we have observed some of the worst bushfires in recent history. In the ocean, coral reefs are dying at an unprecedented rate as increasing water temperatures are causing them to bleach out. This is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

            <div class="context">
                <p class="singleBlock", style="padding: 1px;">We can clearly see that there's a <b>strong positive correlation between CO2 output, GDP per capita, and temperature change</b>.</p>
                <p class="singleBlock">This does certainly make a lot of sense when we consider economic activities such as mining, manufacturing, and farming consume tremendous amounts of fossil fuel to operate heavy machinery, transport goods, as well as conducting financial transactions.</p>

                <p class="singleBlock">In recent years, <i>Australia's</i> CO2 emission is comparable to economic powerhouses like the <i>United States</i> and <i>China</i> despite having a population size of roughly 20 million people</p>
                <p class="singleBlock"><b>2010</b> was the first time when <i>Australia's</i> CO2 emission per capita exceeded that of the <i>United States</i> at <b>17.581 metric tonnes</b> (vs 17.434 metric tonnes).</p>
                <p class="singleBlock"><i>Australia</i> has been beating the <i>United States</i> in this department after almost every subsequent years.</p>

                <p class="singleBlock", style="padding: 0px;">It seems like the country heavily relies on fossil fuels to keep up with domestic demands.</p>
                <p class="singleBlock", style="padding: 0px;"><i>Mining</i> eats up a sizeable chunk of the electricity pie. Perhaps we can leverage that to reduce our CO2 emissions?</p>

                <p class="leftBlock" style="padding:1px"><span style="color: #2EEB27;"><b>Uranium</b></span> is a naturally occuring resource that can be used to generate carbon-neutral electricity. Waste generated by nuclear fission are minimal because according to the <i>World Nuclear Association</i>, around <b>97%</b> of nuclear by-products are recycleable.</b> Most of the recycled waste will be combined with new nuclear materials to produce additional fuel rods.</p>
                <p class="rightBlock" style="padding: 1px;"><i>Australia</i> has been blessed with almost a third of the world's <span style="color: #2EEB27;"><b>Uranium</b></span> deposits. Unfortunately, it has been utilizing almost none of it other than for exportation. According to the <i>Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade</i>, the amount of Uranium ores exported between 2018 and 2019 could generate <b>97%</b> of Australia's electricity alone.</p>
